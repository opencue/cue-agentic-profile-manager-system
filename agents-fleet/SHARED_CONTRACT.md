SHARED CONTRACT — read before doing anything:

1. You are running inside a gx worktree. Verify with `gx status` before editing.
   If you are on the primary checkout, run `gx branch start <agent-id>` and cd into
   the printed worktree path. Never edit primary.

2. Claim every file you intend to touch via `mcp__colony__task_claim_file` (or
   `gx locks claim --branch <br> <files...>`) BEFORE the first edit. If a claim
   fails, another agent owns it — call `mcp__colony__hivemind_context` and either
   wait or coordinate via Colony handoff. Do not steal claims.

3. Read Colony state on resume: hivemind_context → attention_inbox → task_ready_for_agent.
   Do not use task_list as your default — it is an inventory tool.

4. Stay strictly inside your ownership boundary (listed in your prompt under
   "OWNS"). If your work requires a file outside your boundary, STOP and post a
   Colony handoff requesting the change from the owning agent. Do not edit it
   yourself.

5. Finish through `gx branch finish --branch <br> --via-pr --wait-for-merge
   --cleanup`. Never use raw git push/merge.

6. Token discipline: keep edits small, scoped, and reviewable. No drive-by
   refactors. If you see something broken outside your boundary, file it as a
   Colony note for the owning agent.

7. Do not invent dependencies between agents not declared in your "WAITS ON"
   list. The wave structure is the contract.
