## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install cue
npm install -g cue-ai

# 2. Pin the marketing profile to your content repo
cd ~/work/q4-product-launch
cue use marketing

# 3. (Optional) Set up your brand voice once
echo "Run marketing-context to lock in target audience + brand voice" > .claude-todo

# 4. Launch
claude
```

Inside the session:

- *"Write the homepage hero section for our pricing-page redesign"* → copywriting + brand-guidelines
- *"Optimize this blog post for ChatGPT citation"* → ai-seo (Generative Engine Optimization)
- *"Draft a 6-email nurture sequence for trial users"* → email-sequence
- *"Build an exit-intent popup for the checkout abandon flow"* → popup-cro
- *"Compare us against [competitor] for a switch landing page"* → competitor-alternatives
- *"Estimate ROAS for the LinkedIn campaign with these metrics"* → campaign-analytics
- *"Make this AI-written copy sound more human"* → content-humanizer

## Why cue (vs global Claude Code)

**Without cue:** Your marketing session also loads cybersecurity skills, frontend skills, Rust skills — Claude picks `nmap` when you ask for a "scan" of your funnel. Per-message cost: **~$2.70**.

**With cue and the marketing profile:** Only marketing skills load. The model never confuses "scan the funnel" with "scan with nmap". Per-message cost: **~$0.10**.

Plus: profile-scoped MCPs mean your marketing analytics tools don't pollute non-marketing sessions.

## Per-channel content production

cue's marketing profile is built around the marketing-skills team's **42-skill ecosystem** (7 pods × 27 Python tools). The skills are designed to compose — `marketing-ops` is the router that picks the right specialist; `marketing-context` runs first to lock in audience + brand voice across every subsequent skill.

Typical workflow:

```bash
# 1. Set context once per project
> Use marketing-context to set up target audience, ICP, and brand voice for [product]

# 2. Plan
> Use content-strategy to plan a topic cluster for our Q4 push

# 3. Write
> Use content-production to draft 3 blog posts from that plan

# 4. Optimize
> Use ai-seo to make each post citeable by ChatGPT and Perplexity

# 5. Distribute
> Use social-content to repurpose each post into a LinkedIn carousel + X thread
```

## Safety + quality

The `marketing` profile inherits from `core`, so you get the same safety hooks (bash-preflight, secrets-guard, commit-message-guard, session-summary) as every other cue profile. Plus:

- **Commit-message-guard** keeps your content-repo commits clean — no `git commit -m "update"` 200 times a day
- **Session-summary hook** logs every session end, feeding the failure-feedback loop. Run `cue failures --propose marketing` weekly to ask Claude what to add to the profile.

## Find more marketing skills

```bash
cue marketplace discover --cli-aware --limit 30
#   →  marketing, frontend matches show up first because their keyword index
#      maps to your active profile
```

The discovery flow uses GitHub Code Search + path/keyword matching to find marketing-relevant skill repos and rank them by profile fit.
