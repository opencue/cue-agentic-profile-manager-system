"""Single-shot reflective skill-body improver — the lightweight optimizer.

GEPA's iterative loop makes dozens of LLM calls and is slow on every backend.
This optimizer does the job in ONE `claude -p` call: read the current skill body
(plus any friction signals), propose an improved body, return it. The caller
then runs the same `cue lint-skill` gate + apply/proposal decision as GEPA.

Needs NO DSPy and NO API key — just `claude -p` (the user's Claude Code auth).
This is the path that actually delivers "skills improve as you use cue" cheaply.
